# Purpose of this repo

This repo is where teams X-ray, Gamma, Orange, etc. are sharing YAML files for mapping 
knowledge-graph-specific predicates to a simplified set of predicates.
The hope is that we can develop a comprehensive, Translator-standard set of
predicate mappings for all the predicates from various KS's (e.g., SemMedDB,
UMLS, various ontologies, ChEMBL, etc.) to Translator-standard predicates.
This repo is not intended to be permanent; it is specifically for the
(presumed short-term) effort to reconcile predicate nomenclatures used by
the different Translator teams, and to agree on any necessary extensions to the
predicate list in BioLink.
