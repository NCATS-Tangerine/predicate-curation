# Purpose of this repo

This repo is where team X-ray and team Gamma are sharing YAML files for mapping 
knowledge-graph-specific predicates to a simplified set of predicates.
The hope is that we can develop a comprehensive, Translator-standard set of
predicate mappings for all the predicates from various KS's (e.g., SemMedDB,
UMLS, various ontologies, ChEMBL, etc.) to Translator-standard predicates.
